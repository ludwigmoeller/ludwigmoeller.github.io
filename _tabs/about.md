## 👋 Hi, I’m Ludwig

I work as a **Solution Architect** with a strong focus on **Modern Work, identity, endpoint management, and security** — mostly in and around the Microsoft ecosystem.

This site exists because I kept repeating the same explanations, diagrams, and *“wait, that’s actually not how it works”* conversations — and eventually figured it would be easier to just write them down.

## What I actually do

My day job lives somewhere between **hands-on engineering** and **architecture**:

- Designing and securing Microsoft 365 environments  
- Building and fixing Intune configurations (sometimes both in the same day)  
- Challenging customers on *why* they want something — not just *how* to configure it  
- Translating security theory into things that actually survive contact with users  

I spend a lot of time in:
- Entra ID (identity, Conditional Access, passwordless)
- Intune (Windows, macOS, configuration, compliance, pain)
- Microsoft Defender (Endpoint, Identity, Cloud Apps)
- Zero Trust — beyond the slide decks

## Why this blog exists

TechWithLudwig is **not** a documentation mirror and **not** a marketing blog.

It’s where I write about:
- Things that *look simple* but aren’t  
- Features that are powerful but poorly explained  
- Configurations that work great in demos and terribly in real life  
- Edge cases you only hit after deployment  

If something here sounds opinionated, that’s intentional.  
If something breaks — that’s usually mentioned too.

## How I write

A few ground rules I try to stick to:

- No magic checkboxes without context  
- No “just enable X” without explaining consequences  
- If something is an assumption, I’ll call it out  
- If I don’t know, I won’t pretend I do  

This blog is written from the perspective of **someone who has to support this stuff later**.
