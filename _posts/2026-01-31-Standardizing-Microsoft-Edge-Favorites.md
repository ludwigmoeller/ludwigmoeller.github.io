Managed Favorites in Microsoft Edge (without the mess)

If you’ve ever joined a new company and spent the first week hunting for the ServiceDesk link, the intranet, or “that one HR page everyone keeps mentioning”, you already understand the problem.

Managed Favorites in Microsoft Edge is one of those small-but-mighty configurations that quietly removes friction for users and support teams alike. One central place. Same links for everyone. No “where do I find…?” tickets.

Let’s walk through how to configure it properly using Intune, a clean JSON structure, and a generator that saves you from JSON-induced headaches.

Wrap-up

1. What are Managed Favorites?

Managed Favorites allow you to centrally define a set of browser favorites that:

Appear for all users

Cannot be removed by users

Can be updated centrally

Support folders and nesting

This is done via policy in Microsoft Edge, typically delivered using Microsoft Intune.

2. Why use Managed Favorites?

This is one of those “why aren’t we already doing this?” features.

Managed Favorites are great for:

Intranet links

ServiceDesk portals

HR systems

Admin portals

Onboarding resources

Country- or department-specific tools

They’re always there, and they’re consistent.

[Inference] In most environments, this reduces onboarding friction and “where is the link?” support requests, based on common enterprise deployment patterns.

3. Example JSON structure

Below is a realistic, production-ready example of a Managed Favorites JSON. This is exactly the structure Intune expects.
```json
[
  {
    "toplevel_name": "TechWithLudwig"
  },
  {
    "name": "APENTO",
    "url": "www.apento.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "ServiceDesk",
    "url": "servicenow.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "HR Department",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "Our idol",
        "url": "https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Toby_Flenderson"
      },
      {
        "name": "Vacation",
        "url": "hotels.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "IT department",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "Entra Admin Page",
        "url": "entra.microsoft.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Employee Handbook",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_handbook"
  },
  {
    "name": "Intranet",
    "url": "Sharepoint.com"
  }
]
```

Yes, you can handcraft this.

No, you probably shouldn’t.

4. Use the generator instead.

I’ve built a small tool that does exactly one thing:
Generate valid Managed Favorites JSON without pain.

👉 https://techwithludwig.com/tools/edge-favorites/

With the generator you can:

Add links

Create folders

Nest items

Copy-paste directly into Intune

Less time debugging brackets. More time doing literally anything else.

5. Creating the Intune policy

Now for the actual policy.

Policy basics

Platform: Windows

Profile type: Settings catalog

Name:
Windows – Config – Edge – Favorites – Global

You can create the policy directly here:
https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_Workflows/SettingsCatalogWizardBlade/mode/create/platform/windows10/policyType/SettingsCatalogWindows10

Add the setting

Search for Microsoft Edge

Add the setting:

Microsoft Edge > Configure favorites


Paste the JSON generated by the tool

Save and assign the policy

No ADMX imports. No custom OMA-URI gymnastics.

6. Enable the Favorites bar (highly recommended)

Managed Favorites are nice.

Managed Favorites you can actually see are better.

Add this setting to the same policy:

Microsoft Edge > Enable favorites bar


Set it to Enabled.

This ensures the links are always visible and not hidden behind menus. For most users, this dramatically improves discoverability.

7. Important limitation (read this!)

A device cannot have multiple “Configure favorites” policies applied at the same time.

This means:

❌ No overlapping favorites policies

✅ You can create separate policies per department, country, or business unit

⚠️ Just make sure assignments never overlap

[Unverified] Conflict behavior may vary slightly depending on Edge version, but overlapping policies are not supported and should be avoided.

Wrap-up

Managed Favorites is one of those configurations that quietly improves daily life for users while making IT look very organized.

Central control

Easy updates

Consistent experience

Zero user effort

Combine it with a clean naming convention, the Settings Catalog, and a JSON generator, and you’ve got a solution that scales without drama.

If you’re not using this yet — now you are 😉

Happy deploying.
