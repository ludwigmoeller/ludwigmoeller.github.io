# Managed Favorites in Microsoft Edge (without the mess)

If you’ve ever joined a new company and spent the first week hunting for the ServiceDesk link, the intranet, or “that one HR page everyone keeps mentioning”, you already understand the problem.

**Managed Favorites in Microsoft Edge** is one of those small-but-mighty configurations that quietly removes friction for users and support teams alike. One central place. Same links for everyone. No “where do I find…?” tickets.

Let’s walk through how to configure it properly using Intune, a clean JSON structure, and a generator that saves you from JSON-induced headaches.

## 1. What are Managed Favorites?

Managed Favorites allow you to centrally define a set of browser favorites that:

- Appear for all users
- Cannot be removed by users
- Can be updated centrally
- Support folders and nesting

This is done via policy in Microsoft Edge, typically delivered using Microsoft Intune.

---

## 2. Why use Managed Favorites?

This is one of those “why aren’t we already doing this?” features.

Managed Favorites are great for:

- Intranet links
- ServiceDesk portals
- HR systems
- Admin portals
- Onboarding resources
- Country- or department-specific tools

They’re always there, and they’re consistent.

In most environments, this reduces onboarding friction and “where is the link?” support requests, based on common enterprise deployment patterns.

---

## 3. Example JSON structure

Below is a **realistic, production-ready example** of a Managed Favorites JSON.  
This is exactly the structure Intune expects.

```json
[
  {
    "toplevel_name": "TechWithLudwig"
  },
  {
    "name": "APENTO",
    "url": "www.apento.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "ServiceDesk",
    "url": "servicenow.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "HR Department",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "Our idol",
        "url": "https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Toby_Flenderson"
      },
      {
        "name": "Vacation",
        "url": "hotels.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "IT department",
    "children": [
      {
        "name": "Entra Admin Page",
        "url": "entra.microsoft.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "Employee Handbook",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_handbook"
  },
  {
    "name": "Intranet",
    "url": "Sharepoint.com"
  }
]
```

Yes, you can handcraft this.

No, you probably shouldn’t.

## 4. Use the generator instead.

I’ve built a small tool that does exactly one thing:
Generate valid Managed Favorites JSON without pain.

👉 https://techwithludwig.com/tools/edge-favorites/

With the generator you can:

- Add links
- Create folders
- Nest items
- Copy-paste directly into Intune
- Less time debugging brackets. More time doing literally anything else.


---

## 5. Creating the Intune policy

Now for the actual policy.

### Policy basics

- **Platform:** Windows  
- **Profile type:** Settings catalog  
- **Name:**  
  **Windows – Config – Edge – Favorites – Global**

You can create the policy directly here:
https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_Workflows/SettingsCatalogWizardBlade/mode/create/platform/windows10/policyType/SettingsCatalogWindows10

---

### Add the setting

1. Search for **Microsoft Edge**
2. Add the setting:

**"Configure favorites"**


3. Paste the JSON generated by the tool
4. Save and assign the policy

---

## 6. Enable the Favorites bar (highly recommended)

Managed Favorites are nice.

Managed Favorites you can actually see are better.

Add this setting to the same policy:

Microsoft Edge > Enable favorites bar

Set it to **Enabled**.

This ensures the links are always visible and not hidden behind menus. For most users, this dramatically improves discoverability.

---

## 7. Important limitation!

A device cannot have multiple “Configure favorites” policies applied at the same time.

This means:

- ❌ No overlapping favorites policies
- ✅ You can create separate policies per department, country, or business unit
- ⚠️ Just make sure assignments never overlap


Overlapping policies are not supported and should be avoided.

---

## Wrap-up

Managed Favorites is one of those configurations that quietly improves daily life for users while making IT look very organized.

- Central control
- Easy updates
- Consistent experience
- Zero user effort


Combine it with a clean naming convention, the Settings Catalog, and a JSON generator, and you’ve got a solution that scales without drama.

If you’re not using this yet — now you are 😉

Happy deploying.
